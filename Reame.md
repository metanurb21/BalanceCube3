# ESP32 Self balancing cube.

![ESP32 Cube balancing on vertex.](https://github.com/metanurb21/BalanceCube3/blob/main/images/cube.png)

This is based on design and code by [RemRC.](https://github.com/remrc/Self-Balancing-Cube/blob/main/README.md)
I made some modifications and refactoring of the code to suite my needs, PlatformIO, espressif32@5.0.0 and to use BLE to work with my iPhone alng with a PCB schematic and gerber files.
